# Optics Lightning Talk

This repository contains the code from my Lightning Talk about optics in Scala [@vngrs](https://github.com/vngrs).

Based on [this article](https://kubuszok.com/2018/adt-through-the-looking-glass/)

Don't forget to check out
* [Monocle](http://julien-truffaut.github.io/Monocle/) an optics library for Scala
* [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/optics.html) a Json library having optics
* [trait Dynamic](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Dynamic.html) of Scala
